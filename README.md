# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

The R run_analysis.R code in this repository does these 5 functions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets provided by the course to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
